            "</s><s>The three body problem is famous for being difficult to solve. But actually it's been solved many times, and in ingenious ways. Some of those solutions are incredibly useful, and some are incredibly bizarre. Physics - and arguably all of science changedforever in 1687 when Isaac Newton published his Principia. Within it were equations ofmotion and gravity that transformed our erratic-seeming cosmos into a perfectly tuned machine of clockwork predictability. Despite the beauty of Newtonâ€™s equations, they lead to a simple solution for planetary motion in only one case - when two and only two bodies orbit each other sans any other gravitational influence in the universe.</s>\n"
